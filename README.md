# 🧠 E-Commerce Customer Value Prediction

Welcome to **Brada's ML playground** – where raw data meets cold predictions. This project applies supervised machine learning using **scikit-learn** to predict customer spending behavior based on user activity metrics.

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting the yearly amount spent by customers in an e-commerce platform based on their usage patterns.

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Given features like:
- Time spent on the website
- Time spent on the app
- Length of membership
- Session activity

Can we predict how much a user is likely to spend?

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- pandas 🧮  
- seaborn & matplotlib 📈  
- scikit-learn 🤖

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `Ecommerce Customers.csv.csv`, which includes anonymized customer features for regression modeling.

## 🔬 Model Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation matrix & visual patterns
- Training a Linear Regression model
- Evaluating performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE
- Insights on app vs. web engagement

## 📉 Sample Output

```text
MAE: 7.2281
MSE: 79.8138
RMSE: 8.9338
```

## 🧠 Learnings

- Longer membership correlates strongly with spending.
- App usage is a stronger predictor than web usage.
- Visual inspection via seaborn helped direct feature engineering.
